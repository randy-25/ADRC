# ADRC Library

### Use Bolder Flight Systems Eigen by Brian Taylor, by searching Eigen from library manager in Arduino IDE

## testADRC folder combined with "Simulasi HILS ADRC.py" gives the HILS simulation for this library, it shows the plant output, control signal, and estimated state

### CPP library cannot be used because the external Eigen library for matrix operation, actually it can be used, but still has some error, so the OOP version of the library is not ready yet

## You can take the example on how to use ADRC library (ADRC.h only) by looking at the example of testADRC.ino
